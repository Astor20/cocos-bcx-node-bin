# 1. Set up block syncing node

## 1.1.	Installation environment requirements

* Software: Ubuntu 16.04
* Hardware: CPU: 4 cores or above, RAM: 16G or above, hard disk SSD200G or above.
* Runtime environment: libbz2-dev libdb++-dev libdb-dev libssl-dev openssl libreadline-dev libtool libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-all-dev

## 1.2.	Install compilation related libraries

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install autoconf cmake git vim libbz2-dev libdb++-dev libdb-dev libssl-dev openssl libreadline-dev libtool libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-all-dev

## 1.3.	Get the executables
* Get or download the node file witness_node and the command line terminal file cli_wallet released by the project directly. [Download address](https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/cocos-bcx-node-bin.git)
* •	Get the configuration file of genesis block[genesis.json](https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/cocos-bcx-node-bin.git)

## 1.4. config.ini
* •	Some parameters are modified as follows:

  * p2p-endpoint: p2p node endpoint, format: 0.0.0.0:port, for example: p2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:8060

  * seed-nodes: set to p2p-endpoint of the block node, format: ["ip:port"], for example: seed-nodes = ["39.97.102.65:8060", "39.97.109.131:8060", "39.105.70.144:8060", "39.97.110.222:8060"]

  * o	rpc-endpoint: websocket rpc, needs to be configured, format: 0.0.0.0:port, for example: rpc-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:8049

  * enable-stale-pket to false to generate no block

* Example:
``` json
        # Endpoint for P2P node to listen on
        # p2p-endpoint =
        p2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:14645

        # P2P nodes to connect to on startup (may specify multiple times)
        # seed-node =

        # JSON array of P2P nodes to connect to on startup
        # seed-nodes =
        seed-nodes = ["192.168.90.46:13655"]

        # Pairs of [BLOCK_NUM,BLOCK_ID] that should be enforced as checkpoints.
        # checkpoint =

        # You can use a block number to set a pause point
        # pausepoint =

        # Endpoint for websocket RPC to listen on
        # rpc-endpoint =
        rpc-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:9040

        # Endpoint for TLS websocket RPC to listen on
        # rpc-tls-endpoint =

        # The TLS certificate file for this server
        # server-pem =

        # Password for this certificate
        # server-pem-password =

        # File to read Genesis State from
        # genesis-json =

        # Block signing key to use for init witnesses, overrides genesis file
        # dbg-init-key =

        # JSON file specifying API permissions
        # api-access =

        # Space-separated list of plugins to activate
        # plugins =

        # Enable block production, even if the chain is stale.
        enable-stale-production = false

        # Percent of witnesses (0-99) that must be participating in order to produce blocks
        required-participation = false

        # ID of witness controlled by this node (e.g. "1.6.5", quotes are required, may specify multiple times)
        # witness-id =
        # witness-id = "1.6.1"

        # Tuple of [PublicKey, WIF private key] (may specify multiple times),The owner of the private key is nico
        private-key = ["COCOS7yE9skpBAirth3eSNMRtwq1jYswEE3uSbbuAtXTz88HtbpQsZf","5KAUeN3Yv51FzpLGGf4S1ByKpMqVFNzXTJK7euqc3NnaaLz1GJm”]
```


## 1.5. Node start
* Execute: ./witness_node --genesis-json genesis.json to see the chain-id, press ctrl+c to terminate.

* Change the config.ini to re-execute, after which you will see the following log, indicating that the block nodes syncing is successful.

* You can also execute the script directly by setting up a regular block node: [setup_node.sh](https://github.com/Cocos-BCX/cocos-bcx-node-bin.git)
